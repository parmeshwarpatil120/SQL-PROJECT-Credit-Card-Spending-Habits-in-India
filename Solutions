1- write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends

with cte as (
select city,sum(amount) as total_spend
from credit_card_transactions
group by city)
,total_spent as (select sum(cast(amount as bigint)) as total_amount from credit_card_transactions)
select top 5 cte.*, round (total_spend/total_amount*100,2) as percentage_contribution from
cte inner join total_spent on 1=1 
order by total_spend desc

2- write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type

select card_type, datepart(year, transaction_date) yt
,datepart(month, transaction_date) mt, sum(amount) as total_spend
from credit_card_transactions
group by card_type, datepart(year, transaction_date), datepart(month, transaction_date)
--order by card_type, total_spend desc
)
select * from (select*, rank() over(partition by card_type order by total_spend desc) as rn from cte) a where rn=1

3- write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends (We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)

with cte as (
select *, sum(amount) over (partition by card_type order by transaction_date, transaction_id) as total_spend 
from credit_card_transactions)
--order by card_type, total_spend desc )
select * from (select*, rank() over (partition by card_type order by total_spend) as rn from cte where total_spend >= 1000000) a where rn=1

--4- write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type

with cte as (
select city,card_type,sum(amount) as amount
,sum(case when card_type='Gold' then amount end) as gold_amount
from credit_card_transactions
group by city,card_type)
select top 1
city,sum(gold_amount)/sum(amount) as gold_ratio
from cte
group by city
having sum (gold_amount) is not null
order by gold_ratio

--5  write a query to print 3 columns: city, highest_expense_type, lowest_expense_type (example format: Delhi, bills, Fuel)

with cte as (
select city,exp_type,sum(amount) as total_amount
from credit_card_transactions
group by city, exp_type)
select city,max(case when rn_asc=1 then exp_type end)as lowest_exp_type
,max(case when rn_desc=1 then exp_type end)as highest_exp_type
from 
(
select *,rank() over(partition by city order by total_amount desc) rn_desc
,rank() over(partition by city order by total_amount asc) rn_asc
from cte ) A
group by city

6- write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type 

select exp_type,sum(case when gender='F' then amount else 0 end )/sum(amount) as per_female_contri
from credit_card_transactions
group by exp_type
order by per_female_contri desc

7- which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014

with cte as (
select card_type, exp_type, datepart(year, transaction_date) yt
,datepart(month, transaction_date) mt, sum(amount) as total_spend
from credit_card_transactions
group by card_type, exp_type,datepart(year, transaction_date), datepart (month, transaction_date) )
select top 1*, (total_spend-prev_mont_spend)*1.0/prev_mont_spend as mom_growth
from (
select *
,lag(total_spend, 1) over (partition by card_type, exp_type order by yt,mt) as prev_mont_spend from cte) A
where prev_mont_spend is not null and yt=2014 and mt=1
order by mom_growth desc


8- during weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio

select top 1 city,sum(amount)*1.0/count(1) as ratio from credit_card_transactions
where datepart(weekday, transaction_date) in (1,7)
group by city
order by ratio desc;

9- which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city

with cte as(
select *
,row_number() over(partition by city order by transaction_date,transaction_id) as rn
from credit_card_transactions)
select top 1 city,datediff(day,min( transaction_date),max(transaction_date)) as datediff_
from cte
where rn=1 or rn=500
group by city
having count(1)=2
order by datediff_ desc
